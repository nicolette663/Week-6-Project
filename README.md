# Week-6-Project
#### This is my Flashcard Project.

For the __HTML__ and the __CSS__ I kept it simple.  I added the **bootstrap** because I found it because it allowed me to give my website a colorful disposition.  My **JavaScript** I made comments to separate the text, and to tell me what I did when I go to look at it in the near future.

For my *show question form*, I created an event listner with a click function and added the UI so it can show the question on the *Question Card*,
<br>
For my *hide question form*, I added another event listner with a click function as well as another UI to hide the question.

I used a **form.addEventListner** for the submit button and used the **event.preventDefault** to allow the computer to be able to delete what I had in the box.
  
Thank you.
